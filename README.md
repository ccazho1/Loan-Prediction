# Loan-Prediction
This project implements a full-stack machine learning pipeline to predict the risk of loan default using real-world tabular data. It's built with good software engineering and data science practices, including modular ETL, supervised learning, explainability, and reproducibility.

# Objective
Build a robust machine learning model that classifies whether a loan applicant is likely to default, based on features such as credit score, income, home ownership, and loan purpose.

# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run pipeline
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
